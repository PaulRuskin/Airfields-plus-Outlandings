UK Airports and Outlandings
Paul Ruskin

These files list UK airports and airstrips which are not in the BGA TP list.  Fields and strips below about 25m width are not included.  Frequencies are believed to be up to date as of publication.

If you put a frequency navbox on your navkit, then you can make use of the radio frequency data included.

My thanks to the various people who contributed data to this list.

IMORTANT CAVEAT
This is a 'reasonable efforts' piece of work.  The strips and fields, in particular, may change with crop growth, animals on them or for other reasons.  You are responsible for checking the data, and making your own judgement at the time whether any of these are landable.

If you use this data, please send me an email (paul@ruskin.me.uk) and I will add you to an email list to tell you about updates.  You can expect these about monthly during 2018 with the 8.33kHz rollout.

FILES
* UK Airports <date>.cup - known airports and airstrips below 55N
* UK Outlandings <date>.cup - outlandings below 55N (somewhat arbitrary definition of outlandings - generally anything that doesn't look like it has based aircraft.
* UK Outlandings codes <date>.cup - Alternative format with the code prior to the name for places that aren't airfields.  Makes the maps less cluttered if you select codes as the display name for outlanding styles.
* UKN Airports and Outlandings - those above 55N.  I'm sure there are more strips - please send feedback.
* UK Holds.cup - a starter to put in location of instrument holds
* Various .kml files which can be opened in Google Earth and allow you to inspect each landing place.  Double click on the entry on the left of the page to be taken there.

You probably want to have an airfields file and an outlandings file.  Your choice as to whether to use the 'codes' version or not.  If you want pictures in the file as well, I recommend Stephen Haley's cupx creator (google it).
