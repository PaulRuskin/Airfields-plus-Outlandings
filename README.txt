UK Airports and Outlandings
Paul Ruskin

These files list UK airports and airstrips which are not in the BGA TP list.  Fields and strips below about 25m width are not included.  Frequencies are believed to be up to date as of publication.

If you put a frequency navbox on your navkit, then you can make use of the radio frequency data included.

My thanks to the various people who contributed data to this list.

IMORTANT CAVEAT
This is a 'reasonable efforts' piece of work.  The strips and fields, in particular, may change with crop growth, animals on them or for other reasons.  You are responsible for checking the data, and making your own judgement at the time whether any of these are landable.

If you use this data, please send me an email (paul@ruskin.me.uk) and I will add you to an email list to tell you about updates.  You can expect these about monthly during 2018 with the 8.33kHz rollout.
